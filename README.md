## Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Property â€“
All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent. The key concept of Apriori algorithm is its anti-monotonicity of support measure. Apriori assumes that
All subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori property).
If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.

## Minimum support - 60%
